 of sarovar as a token of his victory in the Mahabharta battle. In the same island complex lies a ancient Draupadi kupa. The shrine of Lord Shiva located on 
 the northern bank of the sarovar is called Sarveshwar Mahadev. According to the tradition, the Shiva Linga was installed here by Lord Brahma himself. Annual
 Gita Jyanti celebrations is held on banks of bramsarover in November-December. Many devotees consider one prikarma of this tank equal to making one visit to 
 all the tirth lying within the holy circuit of Kurukshetra 48 Kos.</p></div>

</abbr></div>
<div><p>Shaktipeeth Shri Devikoop Bhadrakali Mandir is also known as “Savitri Peeth”, “Devi Peeth”, “Kalika Peeth” or “Aadi Peeth”. Our Scriptures say 
that unable to stand slander and calumny let loose on her husband, Lord Shiva, Devi Bhagwati laid down her life and became a ‘Sati’. Clasping her holy 
dead body to his heart, the distraught Shiva started pacing all over the universe. Watching all this, Lord Vishnu cut her dead body with his ‘Sudarshan
 chakra’ into 52 parts. In this way, the places where these parts fell, emerged as sacred “Shaktipeeth”. All this was done for general good of one and all.
 Naina Devi, Jwala ji, Kamkhya ji etc are among the 52 holy Shaktipeethas. It is believed that right ankle of Maa Sati fell down at Shaktipeeth Shri Devikoop
 Bhadrakali Mandir in Kurukshetra. The legend has it that before marching out for the battle of Mahabharta, the Pandvas along with Lord Krishna offered
 worship here praying for their victory and donated the horses of their Chariots which made it an age-old tradition of offering horses made of silver, 
 mud etc, depending upon one’s means, once the desire have been met. The Tonsure (head shaving) ceremony of Shri Krishna & Balram was also performed at this 
 Shaktipeeth Shri Devikoop Bhadrakali Mandir.

<div><p>Jyotisar is the place where the sacred Jyotisar, the birth place of Gita, is the most venerated tirtha of Kurukshetra. It is believed that
 Mahabharata battle started from Jyotisar, where on the eve of the battle deluded Arjuna received the eternal message of Gita from its propounder 
 Lord Krishna. It is said that Adi Sankaracharya has identified the place during his sojourn to Himalaya in the 9th centenary of Christian era. In 1850 
 A.D. King of Kashmir constructed one Shiva temple at the tirtha. Again in 1924, King of Darbhanga raised a stone platform around the holy banyan tree, 
 which according to devouts is the evidence of the song celestial i.e Gita.<br><br> In 1967 Sankaracharya of Kanchi Kama Koti Peetha. Installed the Chariot
 showing Gita Updesha on the platform facing east. The tirtha in the past might be comprising the ancient temple, but they could not sustain because 
 of the fury of the invaders in medieval times. Architectural member of one such temple of 9th-10th century is placed on the main platform of the temple.
 The Haryana, Tourism is running a light and sound show daily here in Hindi and English in the evening.
